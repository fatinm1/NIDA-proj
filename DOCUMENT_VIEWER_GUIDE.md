# Document Viewer Guide - Email Draft

Subject: How to Use the Document Viewer - A Simple Guide

Hi [Name],

I wanted to share a quick guide on how our document viewer works. It's designed to make reviewing and approving changes to your NDA documents as simple as possible.

## Getting Started

After you upload your NDA document and click "Start AI Redlining Process," our system analyzes your document and suggests changes based on your custom rules. Once the analysis is complete, the document viewer opens automatically.

## The Document Viewer Layout

The viewer is split into two main sections:

**Left Sidebar (Navigation Panel)**
- Shows a list of all suggested changes
- Each change is numbered and color-coded:
  - Yellow = Pending (needs your decision)
  - Green = Accepted
  - Red = Rejected
- Click any change in the sidebar to jump directly to that location in the document
- Shows your progress (e.g., "60% Complete")

**Main Document Area**
- Displays your document exactly as it appears in Word
- All formatting, fonts, and layout are preserved
- Changes are highlighted with colored tags

## Reviewing Changes

When you see a suggested change in the document:

1. **The Change Tag**: A small colored box appears above the text that needs to be changed
   - Shows the old text (with a strikethrough)
   - Shows the new suggested text (underlined)
   - Displays two buttons: "✓ Accept" and "✗ Reject"

2. **Making Your Decision**:
   - Click **"✓ Accept"** if you want to keep the suggested change
     - The old text disappears
     - The new text remains with a green "✓ Accepted" badge
   - Click **"✗ Reject"** if you want to keep the original text
     - The new text disappears
     - The original text remains with a red "✗ Rejected" badge

3. **The buttons disappear** once you've made your decision, keeping the document clean and easy to read

## Quick Actions

At the top of the viewer, you'll find helpful shortcuts:

- **"Next pending change"** button: Quickly jump to the next change that needs your attention
- **"Accept All"** button: Accept all remaining pending changes at once
- **"Reject All"** button: Reject all remaining pending changes at once
- **Progress indicator**: Shows how many changes you've completed (e.g., "8 of 10 changes reviewed")

## Signature Preview

If you've uploaded a signature image, you'll see it automatically appear in the document where it will be placed in the final version. This lets you preview exactly how the signed document will look.

## Finishing Up

Once you've reviewed all changes (or as many as you want):

1. Click the **"Finish & Download"** button at the top right
2. The system creates your final document with all accepted changes applied
3. Your document downloads automatically

**Important**: You don't need to accept or reject every change to download. You can download the document at any time with whatever decisions you've made so far.

## Tips for Best Results

- **Take your time**: Review each change carefully to ensure it's correct
- **Use the sidebar**: Click on change cards to quickly navigate through the document
- **Check signatures**: Make sure your signature appears in the right location
- **Progress tracking**: Watch the progress bar to see how many changes you've completed
